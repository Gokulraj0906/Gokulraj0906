ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Gokulraj.

ðŸ’» I am passionate about software development and data science. Currently, I'm a student working on various projects to enhance my skills and contribute to the tech community.

ðŸ“š I have experience with Python, JavaScript, and web development frameworks like Reactjs,Django and Flask. I enjoy building applications that solve real-world problems and exploring the latest technologies in the field.

ðŸš€ Check out my latest project: [Real-Time Stock Market Price Dashboard](https://github.com/Gokulraj0906/IBM-Project-Sem-4), a tool for tracking live stock prices with a user-friendly interface.
